                    <p class="lede">Collecting clothes blends fashion industry, material knowledge and personal identity. From rare denim to artisanal footwear, 
                        each piece is a timestamp of design and culture. Research and begin to become more aware of what you are putting on your body.</p>

                    <li>Archival Japanese avant‑garde (YY, CDG)</li>

                        <h3>Why it matters</h3>
                        <p>Garments are functional art. Understanding pattern‑making, leather tanning, and finishing techniques deepens appreciation and informs the individual consumption of the piece.
                            In a world where overconsumption, fast fashion, and trends
                             are taking over the market, it is important to take a look into your wardrobe 
                            and decide whether you are sacrificing your values when it comes to your environment, as well as a consumer. A glimpse into this will further reinforce your sense of individuality and make you more comfortable
                            in your second skin. In that process, fashion transforms from a fleeting indulgence into a lifelong dialogue between body, material, and memory.

                    <p>I trade knowledge with denim enthusiasts, leather lovers, and pattern cutters. Meetups and online forums help verify origin and care methods.
                        While at first this can be intimidating, the community is open and accepting. Make sure you are building off of what <span class="italic">you</span> 
                        like. Looking for inspiration is okay; do not let anyone tell you otherwise. Foundation and exploration are all that matter when initially gauging what 
                        you like, and what you do not like. The community is flourishing, and there will always be a community within your niche.

                    <p>Ethos: consume less, select with care, and always maintain. Document! (receipts, factory codes, leather lots) which preserves value.
                        Continuing to build these good habits will eventually be second nature. These provide important details to your garments that can eventually 
                        be used for your personal forums or records collections.

                        An important step to curating what you love is to stay consistent. While this does not mean to overconsume, but rather to gauge your interests. take
                        a little longer to research a garment, piece of footwear, or accessory that you resonate with.

                    <p>Organization can also be a great way to look at your entire wardrobe. This can also be a great time to look at the wear of your align-items

                    <p>Origin matters: ask for receipts, factory codes, or dye lot info when possible. It is also important to make sure the seller is reputable and trusted.</p>
                    <p>Take a look at some of your local designers or thrift stores. Supporting local businesses not only reinforces your sense of belonging in your community,
                        but also aids in your venture into collaborating with like-minded individuals. This can be a great ice-breaker into what can be an amazing, long-term relationship.
                        Interaction between you and your local artisans also provides an insight into their creative process; this includes sourcing fabrics to final construction, to every thread sewn into place, helping you appreciate the artistry behind each garment. 
                        Building these relationships fosters a better understanding of sustainable fashion and may even inspire you to begin customizing, repairing, or designing your own clothing. 
                        Ultimately, collecting becomes more than ownership, but rather a participation in a living, evolving culture of self-expression.

                    <h3>Storage</h3>
                    <p>Use wide hangers for coats, fold knits, and keep leather away from heat, opting to store in a cool, dry place. Track rotations to let leathers rest.
                        Leathers inevitably tend to draw moisture which can erode its quality overtime. Using these strategies will ensure your garments' lifespan to lengthen.

                    <p>Rule of three: verify, condition, document. It preserves the pieces' value and extends wearability.
                        When taking care of boots, it is important to look into what material they are. Do some research and review what products are compatible with your
                        piece. Make sure to gently brush off any debris with a horse-hair brush. The soft bristles of this brush will be sure to not interrupt any of the finishes or scratch the leather.
                        After use a small bit of distilled water and gently drag this across the surface of the piece; it is important not to scrubs, as this can damage the finish. Wait 10-15 minutes
                        and allow to dry. Following this, use a small bit of your conditioning product and apply everywhere and small, circular motions. Test a bit of this product somewhere on the garment where
                        it will be unnoticeable to make sure the application is compatible with your product. Similar to painting, use the same stroke as to not over-condition your piece, as this can lead to 
                        irregularities to the leather, making it less durable. Think of this as your skin, as it can clog the pores and not allow the skin to breathe. This step is optional, wait about another 15 minutes after application
                        and use a water-proofing wax to seal all the conditioner into the piece. This will not only restore, but also protect your piece to further its lifespan. Follow the application process that your product advises,
                        and wait about 24-48 hours after this until you wear/use it again. In about 3-6 months, you should redo this process, depending on your lifestyle. For regular city-wear, you should be more than ready to trample
                        the streets feeling better than ever.

                        Whether it is a something I lounge around in, or a statement piece that garners attention, these garments breathe
                        life as you walk.

                    <p>Collecting teaches patience, material literacy, and stewardship. With time, you will find that most of your wardrobe goes with everything you'd want to wear. Consider how much
                        more time you will save on deciding what to wear. The next time you are looking at tags, consider the materials used in the garment. You will find that much of the construction,
                        process, and price do not match what is being sold. You will cling to your garments as they remind you of special moments you spent with them. I become attached to my clothes and footwear,
                        as they remind me where I was in life. My boots? I wore these and walked miles when I visited Mexico for the first time. This shirt? My friend was clinging to it as he could not walk straight 
                        along the strip. The longevity and thoughtfulness from the makers make all of these moments possible. Without thoughtful construction, these garments and pieces would not be able to tell so many stories.
                        While many people think of clothing as materialistic, a true sentimental value becomes embedded within each piece. The most beautiful part of collecting is rotating what you wear.
                        Sell some things and reinvest into your closet if you become bored. Relight and weave new thoughts and memories into your clothes. Be mindful of the process that went into your second-skin and make it yours.
                        The cliche term <span class="italic">“quality over quantity”</span> carries more truth than most realize—it’s a quiet philosophy that transforms consumption into appreciation, and ownership into connection.
                        Each thread becomes a record of time, craft, and carry a testament to how living art can exist in what we wear every day.
